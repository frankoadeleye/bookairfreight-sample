`Clone the repository`
`Navigate to project directory`
`Open command prompt and enter 'yarn', to install dependencies`

In the project directory, you can run:

## Project Features

`The master's branch contains functionality built uncontrolled input using the useRef hook that react provides. The useRef() hook makes it possible to print the value of the input field while preventing unnecessary re-renders.`

`The 'with-controlled-input' branch contains functionality built controlled input. To prevent unnecessary re-renders on input change, we created another state for each input field that will update the updated variable with the current input field value.`

`With the above settings, we can achieve the same thing using controlled and uncontrolled inputs`

`When the freight path is changed and submitted, the delivery date and timeframe changes, proving that it of course gets affect by changing the freight path, as in a real world example`

Thank you
